# Introduction

The Agave Platform ([http://agaveapi.co](http://agaveapi.co)) is an open source, science-as-a-service API platform for powering your digital lab. Agave allows you to bring together your public, private, and shared high performance
computing (HPC), high throughput computing (HTC), Cloud, and Big Data resources under a single, web-friendly REST API.

* Run code
* Manage data
* Collaborate meaningfully
* Integrate anywhere

The Agave documentation site contains documentation, guides, tutorials, and lots of examples to help you build your own digital lab.

If you are simply looking for a UI to interact with the platform and kick the tires, please see the [Agave ToGo](https://togo.agaveapi.co/auth) project.

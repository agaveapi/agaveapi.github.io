### Application scope

In addition to traditional permissions, apps also have a concept of scope. Unless otherwise configured, apps are private to the owner and the users they grant permission. Applications can, however move from the private space into the public space for use any anyone. Moving an app into the public space is called publishing. Publishing an app gives it much greater exposure and results in increased usage by the user community. It also comes with increased responsibilities for the original owner as well as the API administrators. Several of these are listed below:

    * Public apps must run on public systems. This makes the app available to everyone.
    * Public apps must be vetted for performance, reliability, and security by the API administrators.
    * The original app author must remain available via email for ongoing support.
    * Public apps must be copied into a public repository and checksummed.
    * Updates to public apps must create a new checksummed snapshot of the original app.
    * API administrators must maintain and support the app throughout its lifetime.

If you have an app you would like to see published, please contact your API administrators for more information.
